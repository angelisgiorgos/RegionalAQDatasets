## Abstract

The primary environmental health threat in the WHO European Region is air pollution, impacting the daily health and
well-being of its citizens significantly. To effectively understand the impact, and dynamics of air quality a detailed investigation of different environmental, weather, and land cover
indices is appropriate. To this end, this paper introduces three
European cities’ spatiotemporal datasets, customized for air
pollution monitoring at a regional level. The datasets are composed of major air quality, weather measurements and land use
information. The duration is approximately from 2020 to 2023
with an hourly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of
0.005◦. The temporal and spatiotemporal datasets are publicly
released aiming to provide a solid foundation for researchers,
analysts, and practitioners to conduct in-depth analyses of air
pollution dynamics.
